I would like the keyboard to appear when I long press the search field together with the defaut behavior (whole text is selected and cut/copy/paste menu appears). Could you try to sketch?

```

I've updated the `SearchBar` composable to implement keyboard display and text selection on long press. The implementation:

1. Adds a pointer input detector to the OutlinedTextField that responds to long press gestures
2. On long press:
   - Shows the keyboard
   - Requests focus on the text field
   - Sets a state flag to trigger text selection
   - Forces the input method to show the selection toolbar with the system's InputMethodManager

This solution uses Android's native input method manager to ensure proper display of the text selection menu. The default text selection behavior should work as expected since we're properly focusing the field and showing the keyboard.

Note that in Jetpack Compose, there isn't a direct API to programmatically select all text, so this implementation relies on the platform's own behavior after setting focus. The selection happens naturally as part of the long press behavior on Android text fields.

Trying to build I get the following error

                            }
```

I've fixed the issue by removing the line that was causing the build error. The problem was that `findFocus()` method doesn't exist on the `FocusRequester` class in Jetpack Compose.

The updated implementation still:
1. Shows the keyboard using the keyboard controller
2. Requests focus on the text field
3. Sets the selection state flag

When you long press on the search field now, it should bring up the keyboard and focus the field. The native Android selection behavior should still work as expected - when you long press on a text field in Android, it typically selects text and shows the cut/copy/paste menu.

Would you like me to build the app for you, or do you want to test this fix yourself?

Long press on the text field still results in the default Copy/Paste/etc menu but the keyboard doesn't show up. What else could be wrong?

        }
        
        Row(doe
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
// ... existing code ...
```

I've fixed two issues:

1. Fixed the typo in the `Row` declaration - removed the "doe" text that was causing a syntax error
2. Enhanced the keyboard display logic by:
   - Adding a small delay (100ms) before showing the keyboard after focus is requested
   - Explicitly showing the keyboard again in the `LaunchedEffect` after the delay

The delay is important because sometimes Android needs a moment between getting focus and being ready to show the keyboard. This approach should now properly:

1. Show the keyboard when you long press the search field
2. Maintain the default selection behavior (text selection and cut/copy/paste menu)

These changes address the timing issue that was likely preventing the keyboard from appearing. The small delay ensures the focus is properly set before the keyboard controller tries to show the keyboard.
